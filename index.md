## Welcome to my homepage

Time will not turn back, life has no if, cherish the present have.  
The adult world, who is not on the side of the collapse, on the side of healing.  How many times, all kinds of grievances welled up in my heart, words to the mouth but feel unworthy to mention.  
Life is never as good as you think it is, but it's never as bad as you think it is.  
Tomorrow is another day. May you live the life you want to live, without fear and shining.
